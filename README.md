Scene - Think of it as a container that holds everything the camera will see. 

The camera acts like the eye of the viewer. It defines the perspective from which the scene is rendered. 

Perspective Camera: Mimics human vision, making closer objects appear larger.

Renderer - The renderer takes the scene and the camera's viewpoint and translates it all into a final image.
